# Blog Integration

## Overview

## Features

### Blog Pages
- **`/blog`** - Main blog listing page with featured and recent articles
- **`/blog/[slug]`** - Individual article pages with full content
- **`/admin`** - Admin interface for managing post status

### Database Integration
- Direct PostgreSQL connection using `pg` library
- No ORM dependencies (Prisma setup available but not required)
- Environment variable: `DATABASE_URL`

### Article Features
- **Status Management**: Draft, Published, Archived
- **Video Integration**: Links to original YouTube videos
- **Channel Attribution**: Source channel information
- **Reading Metrics**: Word count and estimated reading time
- **Content**: AI-generated articles from video transcripts + research
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout

## Database Schema

The blog uses the `posts` table with the following key fields:
- `title`, `slug`, `content`, `excerpt`
- `post_type` (blog/video/audio)
- `status` (draft/published/archived)
- `youtube_video_id`, `youtube_channel_id`

## Styling

The blog uses the existing design system:
