# HU$H (Aaron Shier)

**Senior Full-Stack & Creative-Audio Engineer**  
Engineer-artist who unfolds solutions where there’s no template—and ships them reliable.

## About

I turn rough needs into dependable tools—rapid prototypes that harden into production. Core overlap:
- **Web/App:** React, Next.js, React Native, NestJS/Node, TypeScript
- **Audio/ML:** C++/JUCE, DSP, MIDI/MTC, ONNX, local inference, Max for Live
- **Growth/Perf:** CRO/A/B frameworks, analytics hygiene, Core Web Vitals
- **Live Tech:** clocking networks, fail-safes, stage-reliable systems

If a team says “not possible,” I map constraints, build the path, and make it stable enough for stage or scale.

## Selected Experience

### Founding Engineer — **Audialab** (Audio AI Plugins) • 2023–Present
- **Stable Audio Open** official beta contractor (early access); converted insights into a product lead for **DeepSampler2**.
- Built **DeepSampler2** — *first text→audio-sample VST*.
- Authored **Audialab Engine** (Python) — local model host with hot-swappable community/HF models; offline, fast, creator-friendly.
- Created **Interloper** end-to-end (spec → prototype → release): React/Vite UI + C++/JUCE backend with **embedded ONNX** (no external engine).

### Contract Engineer — **565 Media** • 2016–Present *(part-time since music deal)*
- Modular landing-page system powering UA at scale for **Hungryroot** *(early stage → ~\$1B valuation)*.
- Continuous A/B, clean analytics events, SEO-aware React/Next builds, CI/CD; **Core Web Vitals in the green** so paid traffic actually converts.
- Additional client work incl. **CandyClub** and others.

### Full-Stack Engineer — **OneShotMove** • 2018
- Built **booking + instant quoting + payments** platform:
  - Google Maps mileage calc → accurate quote → online checkout.
  - **Google Calendar** integration for live crew availability and scheduling rules.
  - Result: streamlined ops + seamless UX; **#1 on Yelp in Los Angeles (2018)**.

### Consulting Engineer — **Ric Wake / Caroline Jones** • 2020–2022
- Designed **one-person, on-stage live-looping** rig with fail-safe recovery (industry said “not possible”).
- Custom **Max for Live** devices; tight sync with **Nir Z** using MIDI timecode + networked clocking.

### UE5/Game Tech (Consult) — **deadmau5** • 2024–Present
- Unblocked TestFlight pipeline for Unreal title; documented a repeatable release path; ongoing technical advisement.

### Founder/Engineer — **Iowa COVID County Tracker** • 2020
- Ingested & normalized IA state reports into county-level dashboards for trend visibility; **covered by Southeast Iowa Union**.

> **Note:** A past stabilization engagement at “SecretSauceGroup” is intentionally **omitted** from public pages due to company ownership litigation during/after the work. Keep for interview context only.

## Accomplishments (Engineering)

- **First-to-market:** turned Stable Audio Open **early access** into **DeepSampler2** (text→sample VST).
- **Scale & growth:** Hungryroot LP/analytics stack that supported paid acquisition as valuation grew toward \$1B.
- **“Not possible” → shipped:** working live-looping prototype delivered within **one week**, hardened for stage reliability.
- **Press/Credits:** *Iron Man 3* soundtrack credit; Southeast Iowa Union write-up on COVID tracker.
- **Team leverage:** patterns documented so clients can extend systems **without** me.

## Creative (Highlights)

*(Framed as wins; primary focus remains engineering value.)*
- Releases and collaborations with **Tech N9ne** (incl. feature with **Kim Dracula**).
- Viral **Kazoo Kid** remix (with **Mike Diva**); multiple **SiriusXM** remixes (2009–2012).
- Produced **Orgy — “Talk Sick.”**

## Projects

### DeepSampler2
- **What:** First text→audio-sample VST.
- **How:** Built from **Stable Audio Open** early access; integrated with **Audialab Engine** for local inference.
- built using JUCE in C++ and React Vite for the webview frontend

### Interloper
- **What:** JUCE plugin with **embedded ONNX** for in-plugin sample generation.
- **Stack:** C++/JUCE backend, React/Vite UI; no external engine → lower setup friction and support load.

### Audialab Engine
- **What:** Python host for local AI audio models.  Uses pyinstaller, handled by another employee I have no experience with pyinstaller directly.
- **Notes:** Hot-swappable models (HF/community); offline-capable; creator-friendly + hackable.

### The Audioverse *(decentralized streaming platform; R&D build)*
- **Goal:** First-principles, creator-owned distribution and charting.
- **Ownership model:** NFT-inherited class **specific to Audioverse releases**; platform-defined **API/standard**.
- **Storage/streaming:** audio **chunked** and stored/served via **IPFS**.
- **Access:** **public/private** assets with encryption for private files.
- **Oracle:** **“The Crossroads”** computed sales → **real-time charts**.
- **Mobile app (React Native):**
  - Wallet handling in-app; **WatermelonDB** for local state.
  - **ENS** for user profiles.
  - **QR** flows to share/purchase releases.
- **Status:** Fully functional proof; demonstrates end-to-end decentralized purchase/ownership + streaming.
- React Native, Nestjs, Solidity, Goerly Testnet, etc.

### The Oracle *(pre-launch)*
- **What:** Swiss Ephemeris astrology app; multi-chart workflow (natal, transits, progressions, returns).  Google and apple calendar integrations.  Chatbot with pinned charts and scheduling tool access.  Synestry charts with custom relationship types.  Daily insights built from a pipeline of 5 charts for each day of the week.

- **Notes:** Pre-launch; show via demo/screen recording in interviews.

## One-Liner

I build the thing others say can’t be built—and then I make it stable enough to tour or scale.
